First field is file or directory you want to work in
Second field is for tagging your images.

i.e. type "landscape" and click tag and your "image.jpg" -> "image - landscape.jpg"

Good for searching images on your computer by content.

If a directory is provided then the desired action will be applied to all images in the directory.

"Clean Filenames" gets rid of everything following the " - " except the extension, and effectively restores the original file name.
